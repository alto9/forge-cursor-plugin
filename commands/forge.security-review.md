# forge.security-review
## Parent execution model

1. Resolve target via `resolve-paths` → `resolve-config` (fail closed on path ambiguity or memory-repo sync failure). Prefer Cursor **Plan Mode** for research and the plan delta (request SwitchMode to `plan` if invoked in Agent without an accepted plan for this event). Do **not** write memory or mutate vendor/SCM during Plan. Skip `sync-memory` until Accept — Apply pulls then.
2. Spawn each listed Agent as a **propose-only** subagent with: event id, superRepoRoot, submodulePath (or group members), memoryRepoRoot, memoryRoot / groupRoot, submoduleRoot, docs in scope, skills to use, and relevant Instructions. Subagents must not write memory, must not pause with the orchestrator, must not mutate vendor/SCM.
3. Merge subagent proposals into one plan delta. On conflict, Lead wins unless Instructions say otherwise. **Board/SCM wins over memory.**
4. AskQuestion on forks when needed; then present the **plan delta** via CreatePlan when available, else markdown. See Plan shape below. Nothing is written yet.
5. After **Accept (build):** run `sync-memory` first; if pulled files diverge from the accepted plan, fail closed and return to Plan. Then `validate-memory` on proposed memory files; Apply vendor/SCM ops first when both exist; then Apply memory to match SCM; then run `commit-memory` (push memory-repo `main`) if memory files changed. Never Apply invalid templates. **Adjust** reshapes the plan; **Cancel** Applies nothing.

### Plan shape (required)

Cursor **Plan Mode** when available; markdown fallback otherwise (CLI / Auto / cloud). Parent only; subagents propose-only. See README Plan shape. No writes until Accept.

**Plan delta** (reviewable — not a full file dump):

- **Intent** — 1–2 sentences
- **Proposed memory edits** — per file: update / create / remove + the material change only (include high-stakes wording when Accept must mean that copy)
- **Proposed vendor actions** — none, or explicit list
- **Left alone** — in-scope docs/actions intentionally unchanged
- Event extras when the command defines them (Ready gate, HLD gate, Refinement queue, …) as tables — not pasted tickets

After the plan exists, only three options:

- **Accept (build)** — Apply exactly this plan. Whole plan, last word.
- **Conversationally adjust** — stay in Plan, reshape, show a new whole plan. Dropping a line is an adjust, not a partial Apply.
- **Cancel (close)** — Apply nothing. End the event.

Never Apply a plan the user has not accepted as a whole. Headless: same three options in markdown (accept the whole plan / say what to change / cancel).

## Event contract

Cadence: On demand
Lead: Security
Gate:
Mode: plan
Pause when:
    Always — security approve or pass-back required
    findings.md / checklist.md / threat-model.md would change
    Vendor comments or secret-scan follow-ups proposed
# If mutating GitHub/GitLab (comments, alerts), list vendor actions in the plan.
Instructions:
Review a change or surface (PR/MR, config, dependency bump) for security issues against checklist + threat-model.
Call: approve or pass back — no silent OK.
On approve: propose clearing related Open findings; note checklist gates that passed for this change only if durable.
On pass-back: propose findings.md Open/Blockers with impact + fix intent; remove findings that no longer apply.
Propose threat-model.md updates only when assets/boundaries/threats actually changed; delete obsolete threats/mitigations.
Don’t rewrite product/architecture docs; escalate design-level issues to Architect/PO events.
