# forge.metrics-review
## Parent execution model

1. Run skills `resolve-paths` → `sync-memory` → `resolve-config` (fail closed on path ambiguity or memory-repo sync failure).
2. Spawn each listed Agent as a **propose-only** subagent with: event id, superRepoRoot, submodulePath, memoryRepoRoot, memoryRoot, submoduleRoot, docs in scope, skills to use, and relevant Instructions. Subagents must not write memory, must not HITL, must not mutate vendor/SCM.
3. Merge subagent proposals into one hand-off. On conflict, Lead wins unless Instructions say otherwise. **Board/SCM wins over memory.**
4. HITL pause using the Mode / Pause when / hand-off shape below.
5. On orchestrator approve: run `validate-memory` on proposed memory files; Apply vendor/SCM ops first when both exist; then Apply memory to match SCM; then run `commit-memory` (push memory-repo `main`) if memory files changed. Never Apply invalid templates.


### Hand-off shape (required)

Two phases; see README Hand-off shape. Parent only; subagents propose-only.

**Phase 1 — Questions** (when forks exist): prefer host AskQuestion when available; else markdown. One named question per fork; lettered options with `(Recommended)` first. Nothing written. Letter / Other / freeform → redirect and ask again. Skip when no forks. Do not put approve all in the picker.

**Phase 2 — Apply-set** (after answers, or when Phase 1 skipped):

- **Intent** — 1–2 sentences
- **Proposed memory edits** — per file: update / remove / create
- **Proposed vendor actions** — none, or explicit list
- **Questions** — `None`
- **Left alone** — in-scope docs/actions intentionally unchanged
- **How to reply** — required footer; see README Hand-off shape

Reply: **approve all** / **approve subset** Applies this set; **reject** Applies nothing; anything else reshapes and pauses again (may re-open Questions). Never Apply a set the user has not seen.

## Event contract

Cadence: Biweekly
Lead: Product Owner
HITL:
Mode: approve-before-write
Pause when:
    stay / adjust / stop decision is non-trivial
    metrics.md, experiments.md, or insights.md would change
# If unchanged read: Mode may downgrade to observe for that run (report only).
Instructions:
Decide stay / adjust / stop against targets; leave files alone if the read is unchanged.
Propose metrics.md Current read (and Targets only if the target itself changed); remove retired metrics from Primary/Supporting.
Propose experiments.md changes: stop dead bets (Active → Concluded, then remove when no longer needed for the next decision); don’t accumulate old experiments.
Propose insights.md edits only when the metrics read changes themes/implications; drop implications that no longer drive action.
